### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Build a plan for the day (checklist perhaps) during a morning 10-min huddle; consider individual  strengths, divvy workload amongst team; if struggling ask for pair/team help afternoon check-n for end of day tasks and needs for the next day.  Take regularly scheduled “human time” each hour. If someone is spinning their wheels (15-min rule); speak up.

Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.
